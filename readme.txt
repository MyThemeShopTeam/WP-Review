## Why Use Reviews On Your Website?

**Improved CTR**

Using reviews, especially star ratings would help you increase your website CTR. Google and other search engines pick the star ratings and show them in the search results. This would increase the chances of your website getting more clicks from the search engines.

**Improves Conversion Rate**

Reviews help the users skim through the content and make an informed decision while making an online purchase. For eg: while reading the comparison of two mobile phones of the same price range, you would prefer to buy one with better reviews and more star ratings.

**Better Content Presentation**

By using a review box, you are improving the overall design and content structure. The content looks both appealing and better structured for grasping the important details without reading the whole article or post.

**Improved search engine results**

Gone are the days when optimized alt-tags and stuffing keywords would boost your keyword rankings. Google is constantly updating its algorithms and online reviews are quickly becoming a core part of SEO.

Using [rich snippets](https://mythemeshop.com/blog/google-rich-snippets/), Google has developed a way to understand reviews just as customers would. Reviews or star ratings immensely help in **improving the CTR** . This would help in increasing the traffic on your website.

**Great Styling in One-Click**

Customize the look and feel of your review section to make it look professional. You can choose different styling options. With **unlimited color choices**, you can choose and create combinations that would perfectly blend with your [WordPress theme](https://mythemeshop.com/themes/schema/) design.

You can also choose from the two available templates and customize them to blend with your reviews and most importantly with your website’s design.

These templates are created with a **mobile-first approach**to load on all mobile devices. Not only that, the plugins work fine with the caching plugins and all majority WordPress themes.

**Easy and Fast to Add Reviews**

All you have to do is fill the information you need to display and select a method to display the reviews in any custom post type or page.

By default, WP Review plugin can be configured in global settings to either insert your review box at the start or at the end of your post.

However, with the **custom location-enabled**, the review box can be inserted in a location different from the one defined in the global settings. You can choose to insert the review box after content, before content, or use the custom shortcode option. The shortcode option allows you to insert the review box anywhere on the page.

**Schema Support for Search Engines**

The WP Review supports 19 different Schema types so that the search engines can easily understand the content on your website.

This increases the probability of your website to get more visibility on the SERPs which would directly have a positive impact on the overall organic traffic of your website.

**Visitor Ratings**

Visitor ratings can help you improvise your content during a span of time. For eg: you have originally rated a product 4.5 stars but during the course of time, you see that the average visitor ratings are just 3.5. In such a case, you have got a clear indication to change the original product ratings.


## Multiple Review Rating Types

The WP review plugin is amazingly easy to use and allows you to deliver professional looking reviews. You have the option to choose different types of review systems. You can use stars, percentage, and point ratings.

*   **_[Star rating](https://demo.mythemeshop.com/point/fatebuntur-stoici-haec-omnia-dicta-esse-praeclare/)_:** The most common rating system. You can use it for rating any product or service. It follows a 5 point system where you can rate a product out of five.
*   **_[Point rating](https://demo.mythemeshop.com/point/modo-etiam-paulum-ad-dexteram-de-via-declinavi/):_**Useful system for creating in-depth reviews or when rating feature-rich products. Using this, you can rate a product out of 10.
*   **_[Percentage rating](https://demo.mythemeshop.com/point/sed-nonne-merninisti-licere-mihi-ista-probare/):_** The best rating system for granular analysis of a product’s features. __ Ideal for products with numerous features.
